This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript loops involving unintended loop termination using a break statement. The bug.js file shows the original code with the error. The bugSolution.js file presents a corrected version. The issue arises from the premature exit of the loop based on a specific condition.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in the program and is a great example of an easy-to-miss coding error.
